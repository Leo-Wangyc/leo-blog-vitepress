## Exponential and log functions

### Function

A funnction is denoted by the form `y = f(x)`

y is the dependent variable and x is the independent variable

like the program methods, Precise input got exact output.



### Inverse Function

The inverse function f-1(x) is defined so that

`f(f<sup>-1</sup>(x)) = x and f<sup>-1</sup>(f(x)) = x `

which means reverse the depend variable and the independent variable

> like y - 1 = 2x
>
> reverse it we got x = 1/2 (y-1)
